# Contributing

So you found a bug or want to improve `bdd`? Awesome! Here's how you can help:

1) Open an issue describing the bug or feature. Even if you plan to implement the fix yourself, communicating before you start coding will reduce the risk that your work won't be merged.
2) Once the issue is confirmed, fork the repo, create a branch, and make your changes.
3) Open a PR against `main` with a clear description of the changes.
4) I'll review the PR and provide feedback. If everything looks good, I'll merge it.

## New developers

If you want to help but aren't sure where to start, check out the `good first issue` label in the issues tab. These are issues that are well-suited for new contributors.
